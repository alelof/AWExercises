To create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure.

Within the src folder, we'll create a folder named pages with several files:

src\pages\:(your folder structure will depend on your own local path)

Layout.js
Home.js
Blogs.js
Contact.js
NoPage.js
Each file will contain a very basic React component.

Now we will use our Router in our index.js file.
Use React Router to route to pages based on URL
