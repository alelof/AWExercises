// Question1:What will be the output of the followinf lines of code?
// think and discuss first before writing this code

const message = "hello!";
message();

// Question2:What will be the output?

function greet(person, date) {
 console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date}!`);
}
greet("Brendan");

// Question 3:let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// Uncomment the code below and see if the complier throws an error or not
//obj.foo();
//obj();
//obj.bar = 100;
//obj = "hello";
//const n: number = obj;


// QUestion4:Add a strict null check for this piece of code
// Declare const loggedInUsername: string;

const users = [
  { name: "Oby", age: 12 },
  { name: "Heera", age: 32 },
];

const loggedInUser = users.find((u) => u.name === loggedInUsername);
console.log(loggedInUser.age);

// Note:When strictNullChecks is false, null and undefined are effectively ignored by the language. This can lead to unexpected errors at runtime.

// When strictNullChecks is true, null and undefined have their own distinct types and youâ€™ll get a type error if you try to use them where a concrete value is expected.
