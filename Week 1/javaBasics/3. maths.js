/** 1. Write a function that converts a given number to hours and minutes.
 * Examples:
 * Input: 71 Output: 1:11
 * Input: 450 Output: 7:30
*/

/** 2. Write a function that tells you if two numbers can be divided evenly, that is: given two integers, a and b, function returns true if a can be divided evenly by b. Returns false otherwise.
* We assume that a will always be greater than or equal to b.
* 
* Examples:
* divideEvenly(98, 7) ➞ true // 98/7 = 14
* divideEvenly(85, 4) ➞ false // 85/4 = 21.25

/** 3. Write a for loop which iterates the integers from 1 to 100 and prints them. However, for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". */

/** 4. Write a JavaScript program to sum the multiples of 3 and 5 under 1000. */
