Exercise 1

Open design.png file. As you can see, it's based on the exercise 1 from previous part, but this time it's full of colors. Start with reusing the code you have previously created. Apply the colors from this design without adding any new classes or ids. Instead, use each of the following selectors at least once (you can also combine them):
- :first-child
- :last-child
- :nth-child(n)
- :not
- :empty

The colors don't have to be exactly the same, just use similar ones.
