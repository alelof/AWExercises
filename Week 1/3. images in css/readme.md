Exercise 2

There are 2 pictures in this folder: shiba_inu.jpg and waves.jpg. Use them as a background-image for divs with corresponding class names.

In case of shiba-inu, the whole picture needs to be visible - it doesn't matter if grey background is visible as well.
In case of waves, the image needs to cover the whole div - grey background should not be visible.

Tip: use background-size property. Don't forget about background-repeat.
